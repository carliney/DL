### Automated Comet Assay Image Analysis

This automated comet assay image analysis method is designed to identify comet cells within images, segment their heads and tails, and provide TailDNA% output. It also includes cell counting functionality and offers various statistical analysis methods.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Environment Setup**: To get started, ensure you have the required environment set up by installing the dependencies listed in the _requirements.txt_ file.

2. **Sample Images**: Run the _run.py_ file to work with sample images provided. You can configure the environment first and then proceed with the sample images.

3. **Custom Images**: Feel free to try the method with your own images. Ensure the weight file, which is relatively large, is decompressed from the zip package provided and placed in the DL folder.

**Usage Instructions:**

- **Code Execution**: Test the entire code by running run.py on your computer to observe the complete effect.
- **Image Replacement**: Experiment with your own images by replacing the existing ones in the exp-images folder for analysis.
- **Model Output Preview**: View the model's output results directly in the runs-detect-predict directory.
