This is an automated comet assay image analysis method capable of automatically identifying comet cells within images, segmenting their heads and tails, and outputting TailDNA%. Additionally, it can count the recognized cells and offer a variety of statistical methods for analysis. If you want to try, you can configure the environment first, and then run the first.py file, which provides sample images. You can also try it with your own images. The weight file is relatively large and needs to be decompressed. Decompress it from the zip package and put it in the DL folder.

The files in the comet compressed folder are the model's weight files, which can be downloaded, extracted, and used.

You can run run.py on your own computer to test the entire code and observe the complete effect. You can replace the images in the exp-images folder with your own photos for analysis.

You can also directly preview the model's output results in the runs-detect-predict directory.

Please install the necessary environment as per the requirements specified in the requirements.txt file.


### Automated Comet Assay Image Analysis

This automated comet assay image analysis method is designed to identify comet cells within images, segment their heads and tails, and provide TailDNA% output. It also includes cell counting functionality and offers various statistical analysis methods.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Environment Setup**: To get started, ensure you have the required environment set up by installing the dependencies listed in the _requirements.txt_ file.

2. **Sample Images**: Run the _run.py_ file to work with sample images provided. You can configure the environment first and then proceed with the sample images.

3. **Custom Images**: Feel free to try the method with your own images. Ensure the weight file, which is relatively large, is decompressed from the zip package provided and placed in the DL folder.

**Usage Instructions:**

- **Code Execution**: Test the entire code by running run.py on your computer to observe the complete effect.
- **Image Replacement**: Experiment with your own images by replacing the existing ones in the exp-images folder for analysis.
- **Model Output Preview**: View the model's output results directly in the runs-detect-predict directory.
