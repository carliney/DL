This is an automated comet assay image analysis method capable of automatically identifying comet cells within images, segmenting their heads and tails, and outputting TailDNA%. Additionally, it can count the recognized cells and offer a variety of statistical methods for analysis. If you want to try, you can configure the environment first, and then run the first.py file, which provides sample images. You can also try it with your own images. The weight file is relatively large and needs to be decompressed. Decompress it from the zip package and put it in the DL folder.

The files in the comet compressed folder are the model's weight files, which can be downloaded, extracted, and used.

You can run run.py on your own computer to test the entire code and observe the complete effect. You can replace the images in the exp-images folder with your own photos for analysis.

You can also directly preview the model's output results in the runs-detect-predict directory.

Please install the necessary environment as per the requirements specified in the requirements.txt file.
